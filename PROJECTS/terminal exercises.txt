Part II

1. What does the ***man*** command do? Type in ***man rm***. How do you scroll and get out?
-It displays the user manual of any command that we can run on the terminal. 
You can scroll through that man page by either hitting the space bar, which scrolls one page at a time, or via the cursor keys, which scroll one line at a time.

2. Look at the ***man*** page for ***ls***. What does the ***-l*** flag do? What does the ***-a*** flag do?
-The -l flag lists file in a list with more details and the -a lists all files and folders including hidden ones.

3. How do you jump between words in the terminal?
-Option/Alt +left/right

4. How do you get to the end of a line in terminal?
-Command/Control +e

5. How do you move your cursor to the beginning in terminal?
-Command/Control +a

6. How do you delete a word (without pressing backspace multiple times) in terminal?
-Command/Control +w

7. What is the difference between a terminal and shell?
-The shell is the program which actually processes commands and returns output. A terminal is a wrapper program which runs a shell.

8. What is an absolute path?
-When we specify a path starting from the root directory /, we call that an absolute path.

9. What is an relative path?
-A relative path is a path that starts at the current location and not at the root directory.

10. What is a flag? Give three examples of flags you have used.
-Flags can change and even enhance commands and added using a - after the command. 
Three examples of flags are,  -a and -l for the ls command and -r for the cp and rm commands.

11. What do the ***r*** and ***f*** flags do with the ***rm*** command?
-r removes folders and recursively go through  each folder and file and f will force removal.
